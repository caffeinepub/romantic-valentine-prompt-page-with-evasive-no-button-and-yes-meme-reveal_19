  "summary": "Frontend Valentine page UI was added with a prompt and a “Yes” reveal state, but the diff evidence is incomplete/truncated for the evasive “No” behavior and the required static image asset is not shown as added. Several unrequested/auth-related and backend files were introduced, conflicting with the frontend-only/non-goals constraints.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Implement two on-screen options: “Yes” and “No”. The “No” option must move away when the user attempts to interact with it so that it is effectively not clickable.",
      "reason": "The added App.tsx shows state and a hover handler for a moving No button, but the diff is truncated before any “No” control is actually shown, and there is no evidence of pointer-enter + touchstart/pointerdown handlers, nor evidence that the No button remains on-screen.",

      "requirement": "When the user clicks/taps “Yes”, replace the prompt/options with a reveal state that displays a meme image and the exact message: “That’s the best decision you’ve ever made❤️”.",
      "reason": "The reveal state exists, but the displayed message uses straight apostrophes (\"That's\" / \"you've\") rather than the exact curly-apostrophe text specified in the requirement, so the ‘exact message’ AC is not evidenced as met.",

      "requirement": "Add the required generated meme image to the app as a static asset under frontend/public/assets/generated and render it in the “Yes” reveal state.",
      "reason": "App.tsx references the image path, but the diff summary does not show the required file being added under frontend/public/assets/generated/valentine-meme.dim_1200x1200.png, so existence and static-asset loading cannot be confirmed from the diff.",
